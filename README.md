# Social-Network-API

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a social network api that can be interactive with and responsive in preparation for a frontend design. As a social network it is important that your web application can handle large amounts of unstructured data. Creating this allowed me to implement a number of powerful tools to accomplish this task such as Express.js and MongoDB. The  motivation for creating this web application was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, reacts and create a friend list. 

## Installation 

- Express.js

- Mongoose

- MongoDB

## Usage 

First the user will eneter "npm start" to invoke the application and start the server. Then the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

Next once the server is started the user will then open the API routes to see the data being displayed in JSON format.

The user can then test the API in insomnia by applying the "POST , PUT, and DELETE" routes.

Then user is then also able to successfully create and delete reactions and friends.
